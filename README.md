#Overview:
This project analyzes a music preference survey dataset to uncover patterns in listening habits, music choices, and interest levels among various demographic groups. The analysis includes data visualization, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning considerations to better understand music preferences.

#Objectives:
Visualize distribution and relationships of survey variables.

Detect trends and insights regarding music preferences.

Explore the dataset for missing data or anomalies.

Prepare the data for potential machine learning modeling.

#Dataset Description:
The dataset consists of approximately 113 survey responses.

It contains 17 features capturing demographics (age, gender), listening habits, music interest ratings, preferred platforms, song preferences, and mood effects.

Features include both numerical and categorical data.

Missing values are minimal and have been appropriately handled.

#Data Visualization
Visualizations include histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to explore distributions and variable relationships.

Analysis performed using Python libraries Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Key insights included high music interest across genders, peak listening times, and correlations between music preference types and mood effects.

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses conducted to understand data distributions, relationships, and interactions.

EDA helped identify variable importance and potential data quality issues.

Findings showed skewed distributions in interest ratings and listening hours, and relationships between language preference and platform usage.

Machine Learning Considerations
The primary machine learning task focused on predicting music interest ratings based on listener demographics and habits.

Feature importance analysis done using Random Forest.

Target variable (music interest rating) was imbalanced, favoring higher ratings.

Limitations include small sample size and potential survey biases.

#Conclusion
The study confirms high music interest prevalence across demographic groups.

Platform and language preferences strongly influence song and music type preferences.

Insights support further analysis on larger datasets for more targeted recommendations.
